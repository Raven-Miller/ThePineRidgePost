    <h1>Carol Bridge Being Rebuilt</h1>
<p><em>Content Warnings: teen death, car accident, drowning</em></p>
<p>Carol Bridge is an old bridge on the North side of town by the river. It was built over 50 years ago, and has since fallen into a state of disrepair.<br>
But thanks to town mayor Jimmy Hynes, the bridge is being rebuilt. Construction will start in February and in 3 months the town of Pine Ridge will have its historical bridge back.</p>
<p>&quot;The plan is to restore the bridge while keeping the historical charm of Carol Bridge. The plaque commemorating the young Carol James will be restored into it's former glory.&quot; Says Mayor Hynes.</p>
<h2>Thanks to the Sponsors</h2>
<p>A big thank you to our sponsors for making this possible! Pine Ridge High has put on a wonderful fund-raiser to help fund the building of the bridge.<br>
The school organized a used book sale. Students brought lightly used books to the school and hosted their own book fair. The cafeteria was turned into a library where students could buy books that were interesting to them. Money from those books was saved up to start building the bridge.</p>
<p><a href="/images/bookFairFlyer.pdf" target="_blank" class="md"><u>/images/bookFairFlyer.pdf</u></a></p>
<p>The school raised over $8,000 for the cause, which covered a little over 80% of the cost.<br>
&quot;We're so thankful for everyone who participated. The night was amazing, and we're happy that the money is going to a good cause.&quot; Says school principal Brenda Johnson.</p>
<p>So thank you, Pine Ridge High, for funding the greater part of this project and helping clean up our town!</p>
<h2>Bridge History</h2>
<p>The bridge was originally called Oak Bridge. It was built over Dawn River and connected to the road exiting Pine Ridge. The capable townspeople volunteered and helped with the construction. With a total of 25 people working on the bridge, construction took 4 months. The bridge was a symbol of community and a mark of the people coming together towards a common goal.</p>
<p>Oak Bridge was renamed Carol Bridge after a tragedy struck involving 16-year-old student Carol James 9 years after the construction.<br>
The young woman was driving home from a church gathering one rainy evening. She swerved off the bridge and landed in the water where she drowned.</p>
<p>There were no security cameras in the area, so it was very difficult to figure out exactly what happened. Police determined that it was likely an accident, as she was a very young driver.</p>
<p>A memorial was held at the bridge after her tragic death, the bridge was renamed in her honor, and a plaque was created, which reads &quot;A tribute to those youth that have lost their lives in car accidents. You will be remembered.&quot;</p>
<p>The townspeople came together on the 1 year anniversary of her death at the church. Almost the whole town attended the ceremony. They walked to the bridge and left flowers and candles for the young woman.<br>
The bridge was still a symbol of community. But when it was renamed to Carol Bridge it also became a symbol of strength and resilience.</p>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>Oak Road, leading up to the bridge, is being closed down for construction, starting in February and ending when the bridge is complete. Using Clark Road will get you onto Maple Street. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
